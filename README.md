### ‚ö° Summary
UW student blending **data science & machine learning** with **defensive security and cloud**. I like turning messy, high-pressure problems into clear, automated systems‚Äîsecure by default, measurable by design. I am resilient, determined, and focused on making an impact. If I don't know how to solve something I will figure it out by researching, asking, & understanding.

- **Data/AI:** anomaly detection, predictive analytics, LLM tooling  
- **Security:** incident response, threat detection, API & web app security, policy/compliance (ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST)  
- **Cloud:** AWS & Azure (foundational certs), Zero-Trust mindset, least privilege IAM, logging & monitoring
